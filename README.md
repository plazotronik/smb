# Fork changes

This repository is a fork of the https://github.com/dperson/samba project, since dperson/samba stopped being updated a long time ago. This version contains the current samba for the current version of alpine.

## For build multi-platform image (note)

Pre-req - visit https://docs.docker.com/go/build-multi-platform/

Install package - qemu-user-static-binfmt (ArchLinux)

Conf this - https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/containerd/#enable-containerd-image-store-on-docker-engine

Or run docker-in-docker (example):

```bash
export TMP_PORT=32375 && docker rm -f dind-${TMP_PORT} && docker network create ${TMP_PORT}-network ; sudo rm -rf /tmp/docker-${TMP_PORT} && docker run -d --rm --name dind-${TMP_PORT} -p ${TMP_PORT}:2375 -v /etc/docker/daemon.json_dind:/etc/docker/daemon.json:ro -v ${HOME}/.docker:/root/.docker:ro --tmpfs  /root/.docker/buildx:size=4G -v /tmp/docker-${TMP_PORT}:/var/run --pull always --tmpfs /var/lib/docker:size=4G --privileged --network ${TMP_PORT}-network --network-alias docker docker:dind && sleep 3 && docker exec -it dind-${TMP_PORT} ash
```

A-a-and build:

```bash
docker buildx build --push --force-rm --platform linux/arm/v7,linux/arm64/v8,linux/amd64 -t plazotronik/smb:4.21.4 .
docker buildx build --push --force-rm --platform linux/arm/v7,linux/arm64/v8,linux/amd64 -t plazotronik/smb:4.21 .
docker buildx build --push --force-rm --platform linux/arm/v7,linux/arm64/v8,linux/amd64 -t plazotronik/smb:4. .
docker buildx build --push --force-rm --platform linux/arm/v7,linux/arm64/v8,linux/amd64 -t plazotronik/smb:latest .
```


# Samba

Samba docker container

# What is Samba?

Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services
for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and
Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others.

# How to use this image

By default there are no shares configured, additional ones can be added.

## Hosting a Samba instance

    sudo docker run -it -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d plazotronik/smb -p

OR set local storage:

    sudo docker run -it --name samba -p 139:139 -p 445:445 \
                -v /path/to/directory:/mount \
                -d plazotronik/smb -p

## Configuration

    sudo docker run -it --rm plazotronik/smb -h
    Usage: samba.sh [-opt] [command]
    Options (fields in '[]' are optional, '<>' are required):
        -h          This help

                    <name> is how it's called for clients
                    <path> path to share
                    NOTE: for the default values, just leave blank
                    [browsable] default:'yes' or 'no'

                    required arg: "<include file path>"
                    <include file path> in the container, e.g. a bind mount

    The 'command' (if provided and valid) will be run instead of samba

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

 * `CHARMAP` - As above, configure character mapping
 * `GENERIC` - As above, configure a generic section option (See NOTE3 below)
 * `GLOBAL` - As above, configure a global option (See NOTE3 below)
 * `IMPORT` - As above, import a smbpassword file
 * `NMBD` - As above, enable nmbd
 * `PERMISSIONS` - As above, set file permissions on all shares
 * `RECYCLE` - As above, disable recycle bin
 * `SHARE` - As above, setup a share (See NOTE3 below)
 * `SMB` - As above, disable SMB2 minimum version
 * `TZ` - Set a timezone, IE `Europe/Moscow`
 * `USER` - As above, setup a user (See NOTE3 below)
 * `WIDELINKS` - As above, allow access wide symbolic links
 * `WORKGROUP` - As above, set workgroup
 * `USERID` - Set the UID for the samba server's default user (smbuser)
 * `GROUPID` - Set the GID for the samba server's default user (smbuser)
 * `INCLUDE` - As above, add a smb.conf include

**NOTE**: if you enable nmbd (via `-n` or the `NMBD` environment variable), you
will also want to expose port 137 and 138 with `-p 137:137/udp -p 138:138/udp`.

**NOTE2**: there are reports that `-n` and `NMBD` only work if you have the
container configured to use the hosts network stack.

**NOTE3**: optionally supports additional variables starting with the same name,
IE `SHARE` also will work for `SHARE2`, `SHARE3`... `SHAREx`, etc.

## Examples

Any of the commands can be run at creation with `docker run` or later with
`docker exec -it samba samba.sh` (as of version 1.3 of docker).

### Setting the Timezone

    sudo docker run -it -e TZ=Europe/Moscow -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d plazotronik/smb -p

### Start an instance creating users and shares:

    sudo docker run -it -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d plazotronik/smb -p \
                -u "example1;badpass" \
                -u "example2;badpass" \
                -s "public;/share" \
                -s "users;/srv;no;no;no;example1,example2" \
                -s "example1 private share;/example1;no;no;no;example1" \
                -s "example2 private share;/example2;no;no;no;example2"

# User Feedback

## Troubleshooting

* You get the error `Access is denied` (or similar) on the client and/or see
`change_to_user_internal: chdir_current_service() failed!` in the container
logs.

Add the `-p` option to the end of your options to the container, or set the
`PERMISSIONS` environment variable.

    sudo docker run -it --name samba -p 139:139 -p 445:445 \
                -v /path/to/directory:/mount \
                -d plazotronik/smb -p

If changing the permissions of your files is not possible in your setup you
can instead set the environment variables `USERID` and `GROUPID` to the
values of the owner of your files.

* High memory usage by samba. Multiple people have reported high memory usage
that's never freed by the samba processes. Recommended work around below:

Add the `-m 512m` option to docker run command, or `mem_limit:` in
docker_compose.yml files, IE:

    sudo docker run -it --name samba -m 512m -p 139:139 -p 445:445 \
                -v /path/to/directory:/mount \
                -d plazotronik/smb -p

* Attempting to connect with the `smbclient` commandline tool. By default samba
still tries to use SMB1, which is depriciated and has security issues. This
container defaults to SMB2, which for no decernable reason even though it's
supported is disabled by default so run the command as `smbclient -m SMB3`, then
any other options you would specify.
